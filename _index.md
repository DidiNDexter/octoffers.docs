Contemporary problem on the job market
------

Nowdays, competition in the **it market is intense**.
when 50 candidates with similar experiences apply for the same job, hiring process becomes a pure
gamble. essentially if you're looking for a new job and you're not a senior engineer/developer with strong
connections in it, you might need a bit of luck and patience. without the former, you could end up sending
thousands of applications before securing the job you desire.
